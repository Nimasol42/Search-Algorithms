# Search Algorithms - AI Course Assignment 1

This repository contains the implementation of **classical search algorithms** as part of the first assignment in the Artificial Intelligence course.

##  Overview
The project focuses on solving **pathfinding problems** in 2D simulated environments.  
The goal is to find an optimal path from a **start** node to a **goal** node using different search strategies.

### Implemented Algorithms
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
- **Bidirectional Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search (BiIDDFS)**
- **A\* Search**
- **Uniform Cost Search (UCS)**

### Additional Components
- **Generator** → Creates random or structured maps  
- **Environment** → Defines the search space and constraints  
- **Plotting** → Visualizes the explored nodes and final path  


##  Getting Started

### Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nimasol42/Search-Algorithms.git
cd search-algorithms
```

### Run the algorithms
```bash
python src/main.py 
```
